# Quizzicial App
A **React-based web application** that serves as a quiz platform, in which users are quizzed on questions from [The Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and are graded when they are done, with the ability to view visually what they got wrong and right.

*Note: This was a project built by me while following the "Learn React" Scrimba certification course, in which the course provided the design and concept. Project with built with no guidance.*
